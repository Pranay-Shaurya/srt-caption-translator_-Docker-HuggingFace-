# 🎬 SRT Caption Translator – Dockerized ML Subtitle Translation 

A beginner-friendly, fully Dockerized **machine learning project** that translates video subtitles (`.srt` files) using the **Hugging Face Transformers** library. This project demonstrates the **complete development-to-deployment pipeline**—from local ML coding to containerization with Docker and publishing on **Docker Hub**.

## Why This Project Matters

This project is **practical**, beginner-friendly, and solves a **real-world problem**: language accessibility in videos via automatic subtitle translation. It demonstrates:

- ✅ Building & customizing Docker containers
- ✅ Using Dockerfiles & Docker Compose
- ✅ Integrating Hugging Face Transformers for ML
- ✅ Mounting volumes for persistence
- ✅ Pushing images to Docker Hub for global access

Whether you're new to Docker or looking to deploy ML models in production environments, this project gives you **hands-on experience** with the full stack of tools used in modern AI/ML workflows.

```
├── Dockerfile                 # Custom image setup
├── docker-compose.yml        # Container configuration
├── captions_english.srt      # Sample input subtitle file
├── translator.ipynb          # Jupyter Notebook with ML logic
└── README.md                 # This file
```

---

## Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed
- Basic familiarity with terminal commands

---

### Run the App Locally

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/srt-caption-translator-docker.git
cd srt-caption-translator-docker

# Start the container
docker compose up
```

Now open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

> Password is set inside `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., `I am Batman`)

---

### Translate Subtitles in Jupyter Notebook

1. Open `translator.ipynb`
2. Load the `.srt` file using `pysrt`
3. Translate each subtitle using:
   ```python
   from transformers import pipeline
   translator = pipeline("translation_en_to_fr")
   ```
4. Save output as `captions_french.srt` using:
   ```python
   subs.save("captions_french.srt")
   ```

# 🎬 SRT Caption Translator – Dockerized ML Subtitle Translation 🚀

A beginner-friendly, fully Dockerized **machine learning project** that translates video subtitles (`.srt` files) using the **Hugging Face Transformers** library. This project demonstrates the **complete development-to-deployment pipeline**—from local ML coding to containerization with Docker and publishing on **Docker Hub**.

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage

### 🔧 Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed
- Basic familiarity with terminal commands

---

### 📦 Run the App Locally

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/srt-caption-translator-docker.git
cd srt-caption-translator-docker

# Start the container
docker compose up
```

Now open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

> Password is set inside `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., `I am Batman`)

---

### 🎯 Translate Subtitles in Jupyter Notebook

1. Open `translator.ipynb`
2. Load the `.srt` file using `pysrt`
3. Translate each subtitle using:
   ```python
   from transformers import pipeline
   translator = pipeline("translation_en_to_fr")
   ```
4. Save output as `captions_french.srt` using:
   ```python
   subs.save("captions_french.srt")
   ```
